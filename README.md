# JavaScript Null Check Incompleteness

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript where null checks are not exhaustive enough, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The `bug.js` file showcases the incomplete null check and `bugSolution.js` provides a solution that handles various falsy values correctly.  This is important for writing robust and reliable JavaScript applications.

## Bug

The original code only checks explicitly for null values. It doesn't handle other falsy values that can cause unexpected behavior if passed into the function.

## Solution

The improved solution uses a more robust check that accounts for various falsy values (0, '', false, undefined, NaN) before performing other operations.
